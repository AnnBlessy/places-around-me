                A home, or domicile, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for one or many humans, and sometimes various companion animals.
                It is a fully or semi sheltered space and can have both interior and exterior aspects to it. Homes provide sheltered spaces, for instance rooms, 
                where domestic activity can be performed such as sleeping, preparing food,
                eating and hygiene as well as providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote working, studying and playing. 
                My house is in block 11, 1st floor. It is just behind the school and liitle far inside the society from entrance. 
                It is surrounded with greenary and all facilties just near by.
                Nothing more to expect for a basic living than  a peaceful society.
